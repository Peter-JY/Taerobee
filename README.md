# Taerobee
This Mod adds some early rocket engines, such as Aerobee and X-4 (V-2 sounding rocket).

@Beale(from forum) made this Mod, but he deleted it several days ago. I reposted it on Github.

But I'm sorry to say, the writer changed the lincense into All Rights Reserved.

If there is any same Mod has the same things in this Mod, I'll change this as soon as possible.

(As I know, some of modders are doing this, such as [ROEngine](https://github.com/KSP-RO/ROEngines) (by [Capkirk123](https://github.com/Capkirk123) from GitHub), [Small Steps - Sounding Rockets!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/198573-wip-small-steps-sounding-rockets/) (by [Vals_Aerospace](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/208582-vals_aerospace/) from forum))
