# Taerobee
This Mod adds some early rocket engines, such as Aerobee and X-4 (V-2 sounding rocket).

@Beale(from forum) made this Mod, but he deleted it several days ago. I reposted it on Github.

But I'm sorry to say, the writer changed the lincense into All Rights Reserved, and didn't give anyone the permission ,so,
I'll delete it from now on until the writer repost or let someone to repost.
